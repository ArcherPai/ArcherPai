# Bochen Dong (Archer Pai)
*he/him*

I am a master's student in Geosciences at the University of Texas at Dallas, with a focus on geophysics and seismology.  
My current work centers on applying machine learning methods to continuous seismic data, particularly for tremor detection.

---

## Research
I am interested in physical processes associated with tectonic tremor and slow slip, especially in subduction zone settings such as the Cascadia Subduction Zone.  
My research involves both offshore and onshore seismic data (OBS and broadband stations), and emphasizes time–frequency analysis and data-driven detection methods.

---

## Technical Background
Most of my work is done in Python, using tools such as PyTorch for model development and ObsPy for seismic data processing.  
I routinely work with spectrograms, wavelet-based features, and standard signal processing techniques, and run large-scale experiments on HPC systems using GPU acceleration.

## Projects
- **Offshore Tremor Detection**  
  A machine-learning pipeline based on Conv1D and (Bi)LSTM models for detecting offshore tremor from ocean bottom seisemometer stations in Cascadia Subduction Zone.  
  *This is my current main research project.*

As my research focus evolves, older projects may be archived and new ones added.
